My main discord bot right now. Require the following packages.

* aiosqlite `pip3 install aiosqlite`
* Discord.py `pip3 install -U discord.py`
* Jishaku's Extensions `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku    `

That's all that needs to be installed if I recall correctly.

Code is currently on a vultr VPS.
