My main discord bot right now. Require the following packages.

* aiosqlite `pip3 install aiosqlite`
* Pycord, a Discord.py Fork `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord`
* Jishaku's Extensions `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku`
* Better Profanity `pip3 install better-profanity`
* Gevent `pip3 install gevent`
* PIL (Python Image Library) `pip3 install PIL`
* Fancy Text `pip3 install fancy-text`
* MatPlotLib `pip3 install matplotlib`

That's all that needs to be installed if I recall correctly.

Code is currently on a vultr VPS.
