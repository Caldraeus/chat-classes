My main discord bot right now. Require the following packages.

* aiosqlite `pip3 install aiosqlite`
* Discord.py `pip3 install -U discord.py`
* Jishaku's Extensions `pip install -U git+https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku`
* Better Profanity `pip3 install better-profanity`

That's all that needs to be installed if I recall correctly.

Code is currently on a vultr VPS.

# 9/20/22 UPDATE
This bot is now public! It is old, and likely won't work, but I have moved on to a new project. Enjoy and good luck if you try to revive this.
